Travel Recommendation System
Overview

This project builds a personalized travel recommendation system that suggests destinations based on user preferences and travel characteristics. The goal is to help travelers discover locations that align with their interests, budget, and travel style.

By analyzing patterns in travel data, the system generates tailored recommendations that improve trip planning and decision-making.

Objective

Choosing where to travel can be overwhelming due to the number of possible destinations. This system helps answer:

Where should I travel based on my preferences?

Which destinations match my budget and travel style?

What locations are similar to places I already enjoy?

The model provides data-driven travel suggestions to support personalized trip planning.

Features Considered

The recommender uses travel-related attributes such as:

Budget range

Climate preferences

Activities (beach, nightlife, adventure, culture, etc.)

Travel style (relaxation, exploration, social, luxury, etc.)

Geographic preferences

Seasonal factors

Methodology
Data Processing

Cleaned and structured destination data

Encoded categorical travel attributes

Standardized numeric variables where needed

Recommendation Approach

The system generates recommendations by measuring similarity between user preferences and destination characteristics.

Approaches may include:

Content-based filtering

Similarity scoring (distance metrics)

Preference matching

Output

The model returns ranked travel destinations that best match user inputs, along with similarity scores or recommendation strength.
